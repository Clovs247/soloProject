# Welcome to Splat-Hub


# Info
This is a passion project I made for my solo project at the coding bootcamp that I attended. 
This was made for a game by Nintendo, Splatoon 3.

# IP address
Had to disable this application for the time being. I'll get back to it. 

# Purpose
This app is to 
- Give basic info about the maps, and weapons in the game.
- Help organize new teams together so they know what their teammates will use.
- Added a randomizer to choose a weapon.
